# Alien Invasion

## Description
Originally a challenge to create a small "game" using Object Oriented Programming principles to print the names and HP of a variety
of alien ships to the page and randomly attack one on button click.\
The original challenge was timed and specified that it should all be in one html file and under 150 lines of code.\
I completed the challenge in just under 100 lines and then extended it to have the ships as images and in a specific order. I further 
extended it by adding a small animation on hit.

## Still To Do
* Make each animation unique to the ship that gets hit so that the animations aren't in sync.
* Possibly turn it into a real game and continue to improve animations.

## Setup
1 - Clone the repository.\
2 - Open index.html in your browser.


## Built Using
